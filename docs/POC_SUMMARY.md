## 📝 Next Steps for Full Development

### Immediate (Milestone 2)
1. Replace placeholder logo with actual REAL branding
2. Update color scheme to match brand guidelines
3. Add real copy/content for all sections
4. Create 3D models in Blender and export as GLB
5. Expand to 5-phase journey (currently 3 sections + hero)

### Short-term (Milestones 3-4)
6. Integrate Mubert/Beatoven.ai for spatial audio
7. Add mobile-optimized variants
8. Set up Strapi CMS for content management
9. Deploy to Vercel with CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term (Milestones 5-8)
10. SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data)
11. Accessibility enhancements (ARIA, keyboard nav)
12. Analytics integration (GA4, Vercel Analytics)
13. Real desktop application integration
14. Live chatbot demo

## 📈 Performance Metrics (Estimated)

- **Initial Load**: ~2MB (without heavy 3D models)
- **FPS**: 60fps steady on modern hardware
- **LCP**: < 2.5s (target met with current setup)
- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+ achievable after optimizations
